### Road network of Chicago region
This is the road transportation network of the Chicago region (USA). Nodes are transportation nodes (1,467 vertices), and edges are connections (1,298 edges). The data source is from the website which was updating by astabler on GitHub. The link is here www.bgu.ac.il/~bargera/tntp/. They collected multiple transportation networks including Anaheim Network, Barcelona Network, Austin Network, Chicago network, and more. I downloaded the TSV file from KONECT. This database was created by KONECT, in April 2017. All edges are undirected, and edges are unweighted. Study these transportation networks can help people solve the most basic problems in transportation research, like traffic assignment problem.

Figure 1. Road networks of Chicago region. Here are 3 networks, one is the real network, data collected from Chicago region, the other 2 are BA model and ER model network. BA model based on the minimum degree of the real network. When I was doing this, I process the real network in the Gephi software first, then can get the minimum degree and the node number. Then I used the code Professor Szymanski provided on the class to get 2 txt file contains edges of nodes. The ER network based on the average degree of the nodes in the real network, then we can get the similar number of nodes. Node size are ranking based the degree of each node. But I did not control the minimum and the maximum node size are the same in the 3 networks. That is the part I can improve. And also the edges thickness I also need to control them to make the comparison clearer. Layout was Fruchterman Reingold. The gravity is 20.0, area is 10000.0, and the speed is 1.0. I used the statistics functions in the Gephi. They are average degree, network diameter, connected components, average clustering coefficient, and average path length. The length distribution of shortest paths I cannot find in Gephi. But the embedded function for NetworkX was easy to be found via google. So for this part I used NetworkX to get the length of shortest paths. Please see the attachment. Following is the average of the degree, the length distribution of the shortest paths, the clustering coefficient distribution, the betweenness centrality distribution and the connected components size distribution. See table 1, it contains these average data for real network,BA and ER model. Table 2. It contains the variances of each set of data for real network, BA and ER model.
