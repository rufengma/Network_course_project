### Road network of Chicago region
This is the road transportation network of the Chicago region (USA). Nodes are transportation nodes (1,467 vertices), and edges are connections (1,298 edges). The data source is from the website which was updating by astabler on GitHub. The link is here www.bgu.ac.il/~bargera/tntp/. They collected multiple transportation networks including Anaheim Network, Barcelona Network, Austin Network, Chicago network, and more. I downloaded the TSV file from KONECT. This database was created by KONECT, in April 2017. All edges are undirected, and edges are unweighted. Study these transportation networks can help people solve the most basic problems in transportation research, like traffic assignment problem.
